This is the backend for our single-page 2D Javascript-based game. 

Please clone & download this repo, as well as the repo for the frontend [found here!](https://github.com/Emurtzle/One_Page_RPG_Frontend) After downloading, please run bundle install and then begin your rails server with the terminal command "rails s". Then follow the instructions on the frontend to get the game running!

No time for all that? Please check out our [demo video](https://youtu.be/KkO_6orX0ow) to get the gist of it :)
